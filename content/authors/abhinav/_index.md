I’m an incoming doctoral student in mathematics at the University of Oxford and a member of Merton College, and I will be advised by [Heather Harrington](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/heather.harrington) and [Ulrike Tillmann](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tillmann/). I’m interested in algebra, geometry, topology, and their real-life applications.
