I’m a doctoral student in mathematics at the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Heather Harrington](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/heather.harrington) and [Ulrike Tillmann](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tillmann/). My research interests are in applied topology, geometry, and algebra. I was previously a research assistant working on Bayesian high-dimensional clustering under the supervision of [Maria De Iorio](https://mariadeiorio.com) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg). 

{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} Here is my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c4zlfy0wc8gvmb2/CV_Abhinav_Natarajan.pdf?dl=0).

When I'm not doing math, I spend time doing things related to music or fitness (XOR, at least thus far).
