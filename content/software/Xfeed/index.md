Xfeed is my attempt at a natural sounding crossfeed plugin, written in C++. After I have recovered from the ordeal of memory management and concurrency in C++, I will return to this page to document the mathematical details of the algorithm used in Xfeed. You can download the Xfeed as a VST3 plugin or as a standalone program from the Github repo (download links above).
